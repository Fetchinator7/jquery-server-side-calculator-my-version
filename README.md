# Project Name

jQuery Server-Side Calculator

## Description

This is a calculator I created when we were just starting to use servers and still using jQuery so it seems really basic now, but at the time it was quite a challenge. This is mainly here to serve as a little time-capsule to where my skill level was at when writing this but this calculator is actually quite useable.

"A calculator for all your basic calculation needs!
This should be able to handle any input you throw at it! (I'm looking at you coders.)"

## Using it

Clone the project, run `npm install` `npm start` and visit http://localhost:5000/ to view the app.
