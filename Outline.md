# Requirements

~~2 input fields (first and second operator) with the input being validated
before accepting.~~
~~(On keydown see if it's a number and if not don't allow the input.)~~
~~A button for each of the basic math operations (+ - * /)~~
~~A result and clear button.~~
Large display of result
Running history of calculation (array)

## Stretch Goals

Clear the history by clicking a seperate button.
Change interface to look like a calculator (based on the default iPhone calculator.)
Add buttons for each number, but still accept keyboard input.
Allow the user to click on a past calculation and run it again.
Allow the user to multiple to the power of a number (let result = 10 ** precision;)

## My Own Stretch Goals

Add a % that converts a number to percent but still displays the percent.
Raise to the power button.
(84 ==> .84 in array and 84% visually).
